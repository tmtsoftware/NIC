Shared and Common Classes provide general purpose functionality or functionality that can be utilized across different components. This can come in the form of standalone classes, base classes, or static “utility” classes. The assemblies will utilize two different packages that provide shared common functionality across the system.
<ul>
<li>NCC Common/Base Classes: These classes provide core functionality and helper methods to the assembly and HCD level classes. They are considered internal classes to components within subsystem and will provide base functionality to mitigate duplication while providing encapsulation in a centralized location. For example, the implementation of a common communication protocol may be included as base class functionality. Child classes inheriting from this functionality do not need to understand the protocol to utilize the communication channel. The functionality of the base classes will abstract the details away. They may also provide features that will interact with external common software packages to simplify standard system features such as alarming, logging, or reporting telemetry data.   
<li> TMT CSW Classes: The TMT Common Software (CSW) Classes are software packages made available from outside of the NCC assembly code base. These classes provide direct support for the Common Software packages (such as logging, alarming, configuration management, etc.). This package will supply classes, methods, and infrastructure to access the Common Software functionality through class instantiation, static method calls, and inheritance. These classes support the assembly interaction with the sequencers to support integration with the overall high level system.
</ul>
