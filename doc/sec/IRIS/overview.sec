The Infrared Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS) is a cryogenic instrument under development for first-light operation of the Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT). IRIS combines a "wide-field" Imager with an integral field spectrograph (IFS) and covers the 0.84 um to 2.4 um wavelength range. IRIS is an Adaptive Optics (AO) assisted instrument, and receives its optical input from the TMT facility laser guide star multi-conjugate AO (MCAO) system NFIRAOS. The IRIS Imager uses four Hawaii-4RG-10 detectors (Teledyne), which yield a total field-of-view (FoV) of 34 x 34 arcsec at a platescale of 4 milliarcseconds (mas). The IFS offers four spaxel scales ranging from 4 mas to 50 mas, and is capable of generating up to 14,000 simultaneous spectra within a filled rectangular pattern. The Imager and IFS are encased by the science cryostat, which provides the light-tight, cryogenic vacuum environment as required by the Imager and IFS subsystems. Furthermore, three on-instrument wavefront sensors (OIWFS) are mounted in a separate enclosure atop the science cryostat; these patrol the exterior perimeter of the two arc minute diameter field delivered by NFIRAOS and provide measurements of the tip/tilt, focus (TTF) and plate scale modes invisible to NFIRAOS and its laser guide stars (LGS). The OIWFS provides mechanical and thermal interfaces to NFIRAOS. IRIS also mates to NFIRAOS through a support structure, which in turn interfaces to the science cryostat. The science cryostat further connects to a rotator, which enables IRIS to provide its own field de-rotation. The final component of IRIS is the services cable wrap, which routes the cables from the inside the OIWFS and science cryostat to the Nasmyth platform below the instrument and out to either the IRIS electronics cabinet or the TMT facility supplied services.
