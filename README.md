# NIC: NFIRAOS IRIS Common repo

This repository hosts common software, tools, and documentation used for the Narrow Field InfraRed Adaptive Optics System (NFIRAOS), and its first client instrument, the InfraRed Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS). Both will be first-light instruments for the Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT).

Presently the main contents are:

 - an example Makefile (`Makefile.topLvlExample`) for building documentation, and a dependency file in `config/`

 - generic document sections and LaTex style files for software in `doc/`

 - helper scripts in `script/`

 - a java subdirectory containing shared Java classes
